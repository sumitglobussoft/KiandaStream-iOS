<a name="107"></a><h3>v2.2.1 Build 109</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n" id="first" style="margin-left:180px;">
<li>Completed remaining v1.x compatibility improvements (specifically relating to YP availability issues so clients are now only blocked from connecting if there is no source connected)</li>
<li>Added experimental 'streamportlegacy' option to allow for supporting more than one direct legacy v1 source connection to the server (see documentation for usage / limitations)</li>
<li>Changed Windows service install / uninstall messages when UAC elevation / admin access is required to undertake the action</li>
<li>Fixed issues due to a bug in the handling of the 'useicy' option which is now deprecated and replaced by the 'disableicy' option (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Fixed reported issues with the 'Source Login Details' page (mainly showing mode availability incorrectly)</li>
<li>Fixed missing 'UID' value for client disconnects in the main log output</li>
<li>Fixed some clients being incorrectly shown as 'HTML5' client types when they were not on the admin pages</li>
<li>Fixed compile issues preventing the BSD build from being built for the prior release</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous code changes, improvments and related documentation updates</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="107"></a><h3>v2.2.0 Build 107</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n" id="first" style="margin-left:180px;">
<li>Added a 'setup' mode which allows basic configuration of the server when run without a configuration file (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added a 'builder' mode which allows for the configuration builder to be run within the server (broadcasting is disabled in this mode)</li>
<li>Added automatic authhash generation when a stream source is connected on a public stream and an authhash was not already present (can be disabled using autoauthhash=0)</li>
<li>Added /statistics which consolidates all of the /stats?sid=# results for all known and active streams</li>
<li>Added 'flashpolicyserverport' allowing the DNAS to serve up the Flash policy file (as per 'flashpolicyfile') on port 843 or a custom port (as well as on 'portbase')</li>
<li>Added serving of 'shoutcast.swf' for custom flash players to be handled in the same domain as the server (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added listen.xspf and listen.qtl to the /listen* playlist options available (so now pls, m3u, asx, qtl and xspf are available on a stream)</li>
<li>Added 'portlegacy' to allow changing or disabling the port legacy v1 sources connect on (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added 'publicport' to allow changing the port reported to the YP servers and any clients using the /listen.* playlists where 'portbase' is not the port externally seen</li>
<li>Added option on 'Server Summary' page (accessed from admin.cgi?sid=0) to allow for manually setting the stream authhash e.g. if needed for a relay</li>
<li>Added 'Stream DJ' (if known) on the stream admin pages as well as &lt;DJ/&gt; in all statistics for getting the current DJ of the connected source (more formal specification than fiddling the IRC / AIM / ICQ values as used with v1 DNAS setups)</li>
<li>Added 'streammaxbitrate' and 'maxbitrate' options for per-stream or global limiting of the source bitrate allowed for a connection</li>
<li>Added 'streambackupurl' option for per-stream fallback if the original source (direct or via a relay) fails to keep the stream alive (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added server bandwidth usage reporting for the server administrator via the admin.cgi?mode=bandwidth action (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added JSON and JSON-P responses to the /stats?sid=# and /statistics responses by appending &json=1 for JSON and appending &callback=&lt;function&gt; for JSON-P</li>
<li>Added XML, JSON and JSON-P support to the /played response as well as to support &pass to allow song history access to the XML, JSON and JSON-P responses even when public display of them is disabled</li>
<li>Added admin.cgi?mode=viewjson as a JSON and JSON-P equivalent of admin.cgi?mode=viewxml (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added ability to kick all connected clients on a stream via the stream admin summary page in addition to the existing single client kicking</li>
<li>Added 'redirecturl', 'streamredirecturl' and 'streamhidestats' options for per-stream or global redirection / blocking of publically accessible pages when 'hidestats' or the new 'streamhidestats' options are enabled</li>
<li>Added SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 support in non-Windows builds for reloading the configuration file from the console (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added SIGWINCH support in non-Windows builds for reloading the Reserved IP file(s) from the console (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added support for GZIP (RFC 1952) encoding of appropriate page and data responses if supported by the requesting connection and will provide a bandwidth saving</li>
<li>Added a 'View Source Login Details' page to the server summary page to make it easier to get the login details required for all appropriate stream configurations</li>
<li>Added sp=&lt;streampath&gt; support to all web methods which support sid=&lt;streamid&gt; to be able to access a page by streampath instead of streamid - streamid is still the preferred method (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added 'admin.cgi?mode=viewlog&viewlog=save' method to allow for downloading the server log output as a GZIP compressed archive (useful for checking the log output remotely or for support issues)</li>
<li>Added 'streammovedurl' option for per-stream redirection of permanently stopped or moved streams from the server</li>
<li>Added archiving of log, w3c and streamw3c files when rotating these files would cause them to be deleted (which happens when there are usually five rotated copies already)</li>
<li>Added 'logrotates' and 'logbackup' options to provide finer control over the rotation (default of 5 files) and backup (default off) of the log files during rotations</li>
<li>Added icy=http parameter detection on v1 client connections to return a HTTP instead of a ICY header response type e.g. server:port/?icy=http</li>
<li>Added 'url' parameter to the 'updinfo' action to replicate v1 DNAS functionality which had not been re-implemented in the v2 DNAS</li>
<li>Added 'dj' parameter to the 'updinfo' action to allow for scripted updating of the 'DJ' reported for a stream (useful for legacy source software)</li>
<li>Added 'ypstatus' method for the server administrator via the admin.cgi?mode=ypstatus action (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added reporting of the stationid for public listings on the server and stream administrator pages</li>
<li>Added 'streamuptime' to the /stats and /statistic responses to aid in monitoring of the length of source connections to the server</li>
<li>Added /streamart?sid=# and /playingart?sid=# methods as a public version of the verions viewable via 'admin.cgi?mode=art&sid=#'</li>
<li>Added back /7(.html) support due to issues in getting legacy reporting tools updated to support the recommended 'stats' methods</li>
<li>Added admin.cgi?mode=history as an admin page equivalent of played.html?sid=# so stream administrators can easily see the played history of the stream</li>
<li>Added 'useicy' option to control if the DNAS will provide ICY (default) or HTTP (HTML5 compatible) headers for client connections</li>
<li>Improved YP interaction when the IP address of the DNAS changes whilst it is still broadcasting (requires YP update for this to work fully)</li>
<li>Improved handling of source relay connections especially via the server's admin pages e.g. a pending source relay connection can be aborted</li>
<li>Improved handling with large client numbers to reduce CPU usage as well as not crashing when exhausting the imposed maximum file descriptors (e.g. ulimit -n)</li>
<li>Changed 'streampath' to default to / for streamid=1 to improve compatibility (/stream/&lt;sid&gt;/ is still default on all other streams)</li>
<li>Changed config file handling to automatically use 'sc_serv.ini' or 'sc_serv.conf' if present if no config file is specified (better replicates v1 DNAS behaviour)</li>
<li>Changed relayconnectretries to accept zero (relayconnectretries=0) to keep trying to reconnect to the relay source and changed the default to 0 from 3</li>
<li>Changed reporting of the YP connection state on the admin pages to make it clearer if the authhash is invalid or empty</li>
<li>Changed the 'Stream Configurations' xml response to fill &lt;STREAMAUTHHASH/&gt; with EMPTY or INVALID on error as applicable</li>
<li>Changed YP2 connection attempts to not be made if the authhash is determined to be invalid or empty</li>
<li>Changed 'hidestats' to allow for more control over the pages which are able to be disabled (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Changed 'updinfo' to not need 'type=xml' as it now auto-detects how to process the title information received</li>
<li>Changed 'configrewrite' to accept 'configrewrite=2' so now 'configrewrite=1' generates minimal configurations (only saves values not at the default) and 'configrewrite=2' outputs all configuration options (like 'configrewrite=1' used to do)</li>
<li>Changed YP2 handling to show the stream number, outputting of detailed error messages (where provided) and not output /yp/resp/updatefreq errors</li>
<li>Changed handling of the SHOUTcast site player client connections to not send in-stream metadata to workaround issues with title changes</li>
<li>Changed song history and current song titles shown in any reports to use the pre-formatted title from the source if available (does not change titles in clients)</li>
<li>Changed handling of introfile to attempt to strip any tags from the raw file to improve client compatibility</li>
<li>Changed client listener reports (via the stream administrator page and xml reports) to now be sorted oldest to newest</li>
<li>Changed w3c log handling to output header information to improve tool compatibility (replicates v1 DNAS behaviour)</li>
<li>Changed handling of 'streamid' so if not specified then a stream configuration will be created if any appropriate stream* options are read on loading</li>
<li>Changed SHOUTcast 2 source logging to only output complete metadata and connection details when using uvox2sourcedebug=1 (instead of always as before) </li>
<li>Changed all /listen* playlist options to output the 'backupserver' provided by the YP where possible</li>
<li>Changed some of the server and stream admin page header links to better hide invalid options and to make navigation easier, etc</li>
<li>Changed the configuration reload option ('admin.cgi?mode=reload' on the 'Server Summary' page) to also update the debugging options and other options (see documentation for additions)</li>
<li>Changed Reserved IP handling to allow connections from 127.0.0.1 through even if not specified (allows access to admin pages)</li>
<li>Changed the Ban and Reserve IP administration actions to save changes (if enabled) at the time instead of only on exit</li>
<li>Changed YP2 stream registration to wait until the source has provided a title to allow the station listing to appear sooner (requires YP update for this to work fully)</li>
<li>Changed handling of authhash changes via the update option to update the current stream information without requiring the stream(s) to be restarted</li>
<li>Changed server summary page to count inactive relay configurations (if correctly specified) as available streams so it is possible to restart them easier</li>
<li>Changed the user agent (mainly for relay connections) to now be 'Ultravox/2.1 SHOUTcast Server x.x.x.x' (where x.x.x.x is the version and build numbers)</li>
<li>Changed the stream admin page to also report the type (v1 or v2) of the connected clients</li>
<li>Changed the current listener list on the admin summary page (admin.cgi?sid=#) to group client connections from the same IP address (make non-unique connections easier to find)</li>
<li>Changed all /listen.* handling to use the public IP of the DNAS as reported by the YP when publically listed (requires YP update for this to work fully)</li>
<li>Changed 'flashpolicyfile' handling to use an internal copy if a custom file is not specified (which has the benefit of specifying the actual ports used)</li>
<li>Changed console output to highlight errors in red, warnings in yellow and debug output in green to make them more obvious (cannot be disabled)</li>
<li>Changed the 'view logfile' administration pages to highlight errors, warnings and debug output to make them more obvious (colours can be changed via css)</li>
<li>Changed /stats?sid=# to support &pass to allow stats access even when public display of them is disabled</li>
<li>Changed Windows builds to only send warning and error messages to the event log in service mode or if a critical error happens on startup before file logging occurs</li>
<li>Changed autodumpsourcetime and streamautodumpsourcetime to be known as autodumptime and streamautodumptime respectively to better reflect the general usage of these options</li>
<li>Changed server summary page to display configured but non-running configurations along with active sources and inactive relay configurations</li>
<li>Changed 'yptimeout' default from 60 to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Changed 'Shoutcast Metadata Puller' handling to only return the title update (if enabled) instead of the audio data to help save bandwidth on popular listed streams</li>
<li>Changed GCC version used to build the Linux versions (now using GCC 4.4.6 instead of GCC 4.1.2 from CentOS 5.8)</li>
<li>Changed 'admin.cgi?sid=#&mode=kickdst' to support IP address(s) in addition to the existing unique client id(s) support</li>
<li>Removed Ultravox 2.0 (old Aol Radio) client and source support (reduces memory and cpu usage - amount depends on the setup used)</li>
<li>Removed 'yp2' configuration option and the ability to run the DNAS in YP1 mode</li>
<li>Fixed all reported issues with the authhash management system since it was first released for public use</li>
<li>Fixed random crashes due to incomplete / dodgy client requests made to the server (resolved from user reports)</li>

<li>Fixed some rare issues with binding to a custom destip failing when it should have worked</li>
<li>Fixed updating of 'streampath' not causing a YP details refresh (remove then add) on any changed stream configurations</li>
<li>Fixed crash on Windows versions after choosing a config file to use when run without write permissions to create 'logfile' when no config file is specified</li>
<li>Fixed crash on non-Windows versions when processing invalid xml metadata from sources</li>
<li>Fixed some attempts to create / update authhashes not working due to url-encoding issues with the data passed on to the YP</li>
<li>Fixed handling of clearly invalid authhashes to not show the update and remove admin options</li>

<li>Removed REPORTEDLISTENERS from admin.cgi?mode=viewxml for pages 0 and 1 as it duplicated the CURRENTLISTENERS entry</li>
<li>Removed POINTER from admin.cgi?mode=viewxml for page 3 as it duplicated the UID entry</li>
<li>Removed direct support for specifying 'relayport' and 'relayserver' (though if found then they are mapped to streamrelayurl against streamid=1 and will be removed if using configrewrite=1)</li>
<li>Fixed 'autodumpsourcetime' and 'streamautodumpsourcetime' not being applied correctly especially if either were set to 0</li>
<li>Fixed usage of 'streampath' in the listen playlists generated to ensure the formed playlist entry will work where possible for client connections</li>
<li>Fixed connection issues with YP directory listings when no 'streampath' is specifed (now ensures /stream/&lt;sid&gt;/ is set as the path so connections will be made against the correct stream)</li>
<li>Fixed some client connection issues when 'streampath' has been specifed (could lead to sid=1 being played even if the streampath_2 was attempted)</li>
<li>Fixed non-english title compatibility with v1 sources i.e. titles with accented characters, was leading to title issues (also affected legacy DNAS builds)</li>
<li>Fixed some specific stream configuration issues with not all values being correctly mapped to the expected stream configuration</li>
<li>Fixed 'admin.cgi?mode=viewlog' to escape the log file contents correctly so appears correctly in the html output</li>
<li>Fixed issues with 'admin.cgi?mode=reload' where it could cause a lockup (non-Windows versions), caused incorrect removal of a configuration groups, source password changes not always applied, relays not being updated or started in all cases</li>
<li>Fixed logfile not being correctly set if no config file is passed but a selection is then made from the list shown</li>
<li>Fixed kicking and banning not working in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed issues handling invalid stream id values on source counnection attempts</li>
<li>Fixed crash when attempting to use configuration groups where 'streamrelayurl' contains an url</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect loading of some v1 DNAS boolean based configiruation options</li>
<li>Fixed 'allowrelay=0' from preventing connection attempts to be made to the YP directory when there is no relay</li>
<li>Fixed crash when changing a stream's authhash and then doing a configuration reload</li>
<li>Fixed 'include' not working with some relative file paths e.g. include=sc_serv_debug.conf when include=.\sc_serv_debug.conf worked</li>
<li>Fixed listen.m3u not always providing a valid stream url especially when using 'streampath'</li>
<li>Fixed 'configrewrite' to no longer write some old / invalid configuration options when enabled</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous code changes, crash fixes, improvments and related documentation updates</li>

<li>Changed 'admin.cgi?mode=reload' to only be available via the new summary administration page instead of on each stream administration page</li>
<li>Changed the /currentsong and &lt;songtitle&gt; values to be a formatted title as 'artist - title' if the v2 stream source metadata allows instead of just showing 'title'</li>
<li>Changed the /listen* actions to auto-fill the server IP in the generated playlist files if 'dstip / destip' is not set so the playlist is more likely to be valid</li>
<li>Changed the /home action to open the stream url in a new window / tab instead or replacing the current view of the admin pages</li>
<li>Changed the server to not load if appropriate passwords have not been specified (including per stream configurations) to improve security especially with per-stream password support</li>

<li>Added a new 'admin.cgi?mode=reload&sid=#' mode to the administration support which will make the server reload its stream configurations by adding / removing / updating any streams on the fly where it can (unless '&force=1' is also passed) otherwise it will kick sources and clients as applicable</li>
<li>Added YP connection status on the 'Server Status' message on index.html and the admin page to make it easier to see if a YP connection on a public server exists</li>
<li>Added more information to the log generated to indicate if a YP connection has worked or not without having to enable debugging in the configuration file or completely cryptic messages</li>
<li>Added &page=5 additional param handling to the admin.cgi?mode=viewxml stats action to provide the currently held metadata of the playing song (amount of information depends on the source and what metadata it provides)</li>
<li>Added &page=6 additional param handling to the admin.cgi?mode=viewxml stats action to provide the currently known stream configurations (amount of information depends on the number of stream configurations specified)</li>

<li>Disabled some of the admin.cgi?mode=viewxml stats entries not currently being filled in just to cut down on unnecessary bandwidth usage - better use the &page=# option to get specific sets of stats instead of all in one go to keep bandwidth usage down</li>
<li>Updated documentation based on user feedback and related changes, added sc_serv_simple.conf as an ultra simple configuration example, minor other issues & changes made</li>
