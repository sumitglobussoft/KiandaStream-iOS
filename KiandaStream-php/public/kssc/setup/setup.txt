password,Enter the password to use for source connections to the server.<br><br>This is used for source connections where a stream specific password was not set.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This cannot be set to the same password as '<b>Admin Password</b>'.
adminpassword,Enter the administrator password to use for all server and stream administrator logins.<br><br>This password allows access to all server and stream administrator pages unlike the stream specific administrator password(s) which only allow access to the administrator pages of the associated stream number.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This cannot be set to the same password as '<b>Source Password</b>'.
portbase,Enter the port which clients and sources use to connect to the server for all actions.<br><br>This port needs to be opened to allow the stream(s) to be accessed outside of your local network (if that is required for them).<br><br><b>Note:</b> Legacy v1 sources are only able to connect to the server on '<b>Server Port + 1</b>' e.g. 8001 if 'Server Port' is 8000.<br><br>This means this additional port needs to be opened as well if you want to allow legacy v1 sources from outside of your network.
maxuser,Enter the maximum number of clients which are allowed to connect to the server at once.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This is the upper limit applied across all active streams and cannot be exceeded.
publicserver,Select how the server should work for being listed in the <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com"><b>SHOUTcast Directory</b></a>.<br><br><b>Set by source (Default)</b><br>Use the setting provided by the source. An authhash is needed for any streams which are set to be listed (public).<br><br><b>Listed (Public)</b><br>Forces the server to list streams in the Directory. An authhash is needed for any streams which are listed (public).<br><br><b>Not listed (Private)</b><br>Forces the server to not list streams in the Directory even if the source specifies it. An authhash is not needed for these streams.
streams,Enable this option to setup specific stream configuration(s) in the next part of setup.<br><br>If not enabled, source(s) can connect to the server using '<b>Source Password</b>' and specifying any stream number (if not already connected on that stream number).<br><br>If enabled, source(s) will only be able to connect to the specified stream(s) using the settings in stage 2 of setup. Any connection on an unspecified stream will be rejected.
authhash,Enable this option to allow the automatic generation of an authhash for public streams. This uses the information provided by the first stream source connecting to a <b>public</b> stream.<br><br><b>Notes:</b> If uncertain, leave this option checked.<br><br>This is <u>not</u> guaranteed to create an authhash and depends on the quality of the information provided by the connected stream source.<br><br>If the authhash cannot be created (as seen in the log output) or the details from the source are not correct or as desired, instructions on how to create / update an authhash are <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_Authhash_Management"><b>here</b></a>.

num_streams,Enter the number of streams you want to pre-configure for this server instance.<br><br>If no streams are pre-configured then the server defaults and passwords set in stage 1 will be used for all sources and streams.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If only '<b>Number of Streams</b>' is specified, it will make the server only accept source connections for the stream numbers shown.
EndPoint	PasswordInput,Enter the password to use for source connections made to this stream only.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This cannot be the same as the '<b>Password</b>' from stage 1.<br><br>If not specified, '<b>Source Password</b>' from stage 1 will be used.
EndPoint	AdminInput,Enter the administrator password to use for all administrator logins for this stream only.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This cannot be the same as the '<b>Administrator Password</b>' from stage 1.<br><br>If not specified, '<b>Administrator Password</b>' from stage 1 will be used.
EndPoint	MaxUserInput,Enter the maximum number of clients which are allowed to connect to the stream at once.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This is limited to '<b>Maximum Listeners</b>' from stage 1.<br><br>This can actually be less whilst the server is running if other streams have client connections and the '<b>Maximum Listeners</b>' limit is reached for all the active streams.
EndPoint	PathInput,This can be used to enter a custom path clients use to directly access the stream e.g. http://serveraddress:serverport/&lt;path&gt;<br><br><b>Note:</b> If not specified, the server will default to <b>/</b> or <b>/stream/#/</b> (<b>#</b> is the stream number) for the paths in the listen playlists available.
EndPoint	AuthHashInput,This can be used to enter an already known authhash to allow registration of the stream with the SHOUTcast 2.0 Directory system.<br><br><b>Note:</b> For a new stream or if not re-using an existing authhash, leave this option <u>empty</u>.<br><br>Authhash(s) can be obtained once setup is complete and following the instructions <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_Authhash_Management"><b>here</b></a>.

preview,This shows all of the information you have entered to check over before the server will generate a config file to use.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Options not specified when there is a master option able to be used will not be shown here e.g. no stream specific source password having been entered.

prev	b,Click '<b>Back</b>' to return to the previous stage of the setup process.
continue	b,Click '<b>Continue</b>' to proceed to the next stage of setup based on the options choosen.
exit	b,Click '<b>Exit</b>' to end the setup process.<br><br>No configuration details will be saved.
reset,Click '<b>Reset Setup To Default</b>' to put setup back into a default state.<br><br>This will remove any non-default values you have entered and this cannot be reversed.
exit,Click '<b>Exit</b>' to exit the setup process. The configuration details have been saved into <b>sc_serv.conf</b> which can be found in the same folder as the sc_serv program file.
runserver,Click '<b>Run Server</b>' to start the server in broadcasting mode with the configuration details just saved into <b>sc_serv.conf</b> which can be found in the same folder as the sc_serv program file.
