<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p>The aim of this document is to help guide you through the process of getting a SHOUTcast 2 system installed and broadcasting so people can connect to it through the SHOUTcast Radio Directory and hear the great content you have and want to provide to the world.</p>
<p>It is assumed you know how to setup your network to allow your DNAS Server to be visible when broadcasting on the internet (if required) which includes any router(s) and port(s).</p>
<p>This guide will refer you to appropriate places in the documentation provided with the tools. These referenced sections provide more detailed information on the option or feature such as what would need to be set in the Transcoder configuration to allow it to work with the DNAS Server being setup.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="What_is_SHOUTcast?"></a><h2>1.1.&nbsp;What is SHOUTcast? <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>If you are new to SHOUTcast then this is probably something you may have already asked or
you are trying to find out.</p>
<p><br>At its most basic, the SHOUTcast system is based around a 'client + server' configuration which allows you to run a DNAS Server (either directly or via a hosted service) which can then provide stream(s) of the 'source' connected to the server to any clients connected to the DNAS Server.</p>
<p><br>So a simple SHOUTcast setup would consist of the following:</p>
<p><img style="width:328px;padding-left:30px;" alt="Simple SHOUTcast System" src="res/Simple.png"></p>
<p><br>This is not the only way to setup a SHOUTcast system and more examples can be seen in the
shoutcast_system_overview.txt which goes into more detail about the way SHOUTcast works
as well as other ways of setting up a SHOUTcast system (see <a href="#What_is_Required?">section 2.0</a>).</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Windows_Users"></a><h2>1.2.&nbsp;Windows Users <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>The SHOUTcast DNAS Server and Transcoder are both built to be run from the command-line console (or as a native service if using this mode) which may appear to be daunting when most interaction done with the operating system is done via a graphical interface (GUI).</p>
<p>If you are not acquainted with using the command-line console then you will need to find a guide which shows you the basics of using the command-line console along with getting you familiar with using it before trying to get any of the SHOUTcast tools running. If you search for 'how to use the command prompt' then you should find a guide which you can follow to help get you knowledgeable enough with using the command-line console.</p>
<p>This may appear to be a step backwards if you previously used the v1 DNAS Server with its very basic GUI wrapper which otherwise was acting in the same manner as the command-line console just without the look of the operating system. However the v1 DNAS Server was at its core a command-line tool just like the v2 DNAS Server is now.</p>
<p>With the DNAS Server and Transcoder, in most cases you will just need to double-click a file to get them running. For more advanced functionality it is assumed you have a basic knowledge of how to use the command-line console for the platform you decide to install the tools on i.e. how to run and control a program via the command-line console including being able to pass commands and the sending of signals as is appropriate to the platform.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Windows_Vista_and_Newer_Specifics"></a><h2>1.3.&nbsp;Windows Vista and Newer Specifics <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>Due to the UAC feature (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control</a>) of these OSes you will need to remember the effect that this will have on editing and saving of files.</p>
<p>By default the Windows versions of the installer will choose the native 'Program Files' folder (<font style="color:red;"><b>*</b></font>) but unless you have disabled UAC or do not have full access to the folder then you will find attempts to save and edit any configuration files will not work.</p>
<p>If this is an issue then you should either choose a different folder of all of the files or change where the tools are trying to save files and also to save any changes in your configuration files with a text editor which is running with administrator permissions.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate inconvenience though for making it easier to known where all of the configuration examples and documentation can be found is better. Finally there is no reason not to choose a different folder when installing the tools if you experience this.</p>
<p><br>(<font style="color:red;"><b>*</b></font>) This will be slightly different depending on if you are using the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the OS as well as the language of the OS. As well the installer will pick the native 'Program Files' folder so installing the 32-bit version on the 64-bit OS will use 'Program Files (x86)' whereas installing the 64-bit version on the same OS will use 'Program Files'.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="What_is_Required?"></a><h2>2.&nbsp;What is Required? <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>To make your SHOUTcast system you will need the following software tools and hardware:</p>
<p><ul class="n">
<li>A computer (real or virtual) running a supported operating system (see <a href="#Supported_Operating_Systems">section 2.1</a>)</li>
<li>SHOUTcast DNAS Server</li>
<li>An input source (Transcoder, Winamp plus Source DSP plug-in, 3rd party source)</li>
<li>Media or DJ's or a Capture device i.e. the content you want to provide to people</li>
</ul></p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Supported_Operating_Systems"></a><h2>2.1.&nbsp;Supported Operating Systems <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>There are versions of the DNAS Server and Transcoder available on the following operating
systems:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">Windows 32-bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8<br>
Windows 64-bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8<br>
<br>
Linux 32-bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should generally work on most Linux distributions (though is mainly tested on CentOS 5.x)<br>
Linux 64-bit<br>
<br>
Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)<br>
<br>
<i>Mac OS X (not actively developed as of this update)<br>
BSD 8.x (not actively developed as of this update)</i><br>
<p><br>Remember to download the version of the tools which apply to the operating system you will be installing the tools onto e.g. you could install the 32-bit Windows version on Windows 7 64-bit but could not install the 64-bit Windows version on Windows XP 32-bit.</p>
<p>If using machines with different operating systems for different tasks then there should not be any problems with them working together e.g. Windows for the source and Linux for the DNAS Server. This is because the tools use the same communication style irrespective of the platform they are being run on. If you do find an incompatibility then please report it.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Getting_Installed"></a><h2>3.&nbsp;Getting Installed <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>When following the steps listed, follow the steps which are applicable to the operating system and the tool you are attempting to install. If you want to install more than one thing then it is better to work through the guide for one tool at a time especially when you are new to SHOUTcast instead of trying to do everything all at once and it failing / getting confused.</p>
<pre>It is recommended to setup the DNAS server first before attempting to setup sources.</pre>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Download_the_Correct_Version"></a><h2>3.1.&nbsp;Download the Correct Version <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>To begin with you will need to download the correct version for the operating system you are setting up your SHOUTcast system on. See see <a href="#Supported_Operating_Systems">section 2.1</a> for clarification of the supported operating systems. The current versions of the SHOUTcast tools can be obtained from:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.shoutcast.com/broadcast-tools">http://www.shoutcast.com/broadcast-tools</a><br>
or<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=324877">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=324877</a> (<font style="color:red;"><b>*</b></font>)</p>
<p><br>Remember you will need to download a DNAS Server (sc_serv) and a source for the DNAS Server which can be the Transcoder (sc_trans) or if using Windows then you can also use the Source DSP plug-in (dsp_sc) for Winamp (which may work on non-Windows systems using WINE but is not guaranteed and no support is offered with such a setup).</p>
<p><br>There are a number of third party tools (free and paid) which can be used as a source for a DNAS server. These are not covered as part of this guide and if you decide you want to use one of these programs then you will need to consult their help for getting it to work with the DNAS Server. In all cases, you will need a DNAS server correctly setup.</p>
<p><br>(<font style="color:red;"><b>*</b></font>) This is a summary page and contains links to the latest versions of the tools such as when a new release has just been released or is being tested before it is provided via the main SHOUTcast site download page at http://www.shoutcast.com/broadcast-tools</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Choose_an_Install_Location"></a><h2>3.2.&nbsp;Choose an Install Location <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>Choose an install location for the tool you want to install (be it the DNAS Server, Transcoder or the Source DSP plug-in for Winamp) as needed for the SHOUTcast setup you are making on the machine.</p>
<p><br>On Windows this choice is handled via the installer which attempts to select a sensible new location or it will re-uses the previous install location if doing an upgrade of a v2 based install previously made. This can be changed if needed during install and will need to be done if you are running on a Windows version with UAC enabled (<a href="#Windows_Vista_and_Newer_Specifics">section 1.3</a>).</p>
<p><br>On non-Windows operating systems you can choose any location for the extracted location of the files as long as you have the correct permission and access for the folder chosen.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Installation"></a><h2>3.3.&nbsp;Installation <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>On Windows you now need to run the installer, using the folder you have decided on along with ensuring the option to install the documentation has been checked. Doing this will install the documentation and all related files which are referenced in the later stages of this guide.</p>
<pre>If using Windows Vista or newer, ensure you install into a location which
allows you to create / edit files preferably without having to respond to a
UAC access prompt. See <a href="#Windows_Vista_and_Newer_Specifics">section 1.3</a> for more information about doing this.</pre>
<p><br>On non-Windows you now need to extract all of the contents of the archives you have downloaded into the install location decided on.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Setting_Up_The_Tools"></a><h2>3.4.&nbsp;Setting Up The Tools <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>The following sections are grouped together for what needs to be done in configuring and getting ready to start one or more of the officially provided tools. If you are not using one or more of them then you can skip the section as appropriate. Remember that you will need to have a valid source for use with the DNAS in order to have a listenable stream.</p><br>
<pre>It is important to ensure the DNAS Server is properly configured. This can be
one you are setting up or an existing or hosted DNAS Servers as unless one is
running it will prevent any sources being used from being setup correctly.</a>.</pre>

<p><br></p>

<a name="DNAS_Server_Configuration_Setup"></a><h2>3.5.1.&nbsp;Configuration Setup <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>To get the DNAS Server running for the first time you will need to run the '<b>setup</b>' mode by running <b>setup.bat</b> (Windows) or <b>setup.sh</b> (non-Windows). This will start the DNAS Server and open the setup page in the system's default browser and follow the instructions on the information which is requested.</p><p>If you do not have a default system browser or are running this in a shell, follow the instructions shown by the DNAS Server from the open command-line / shell window.</p>
<p><br>By following the 'setup mode' instructions, you will be prompted for common settings needed to run the DNAS Server e.g. passwords. Once completed, the configuration settings will be saved as <b>sc_serv.conf</b> in the same folder as the DNAS Server program file (assuming there were no issues. If thre is an issue then you will be notified and may need to resolve the issue or manually save the configuration file yourself.</p>
<p><br>Once this is complete, you will then be able to exit 'setup mode' or continue running the DNAS Server with the saved settings where it will then be in a state where it is ready to accept a stream source.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Upgrading_an_Existing_Install"></a><h2>3.5.1.1.&nbsp;Upgrading an Existing Install <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>If you are upgrading the DNAS Server from an earlier version, installing into the same folder or just replacing the <b>sc_serv[.exe]</b> program file is all that needs to be done. It is a good idea to also install the documentation for the new version so you have an appropriate local copy to refer to as needed. <br><br>This can be done for upgrading an existing v1 or v2 based DNAS Server installation.</p>
<p><br>If upgrading the DNAS Server but are doing it on a different machine (as part of a migration) and / or location from where it was previously, if you already have a working configuration file then it can be copied over to the new location and you need to ensure it is named <b>sc_serv.conf</b> or <b>sc_serv.ini</b> as this will allow the DNAS Server to automatically use it when started. Additionally if moving the configuration file, check that any paths referenced in the file are ok and exist with appropriate access for how you are running the DNAS Server.</p>
<p><br></p>

<a name="Example_Configurations"></a><h2>3.5.1.2.&nbsp;Example Configurations <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>There are some example configuration files which can be found in the examples folder for the following scenarios if the setup mode is not appropriate for your needs or you would like to get a better idea of what a working configuration file can look like:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">sc_serv_simple  - shows how to get a simple single-stream setup working<br>
sc_serv_basic   - shows how to get a more multi-stream setup working<br>
sc_serv_public  - shows how to make a public server from sc_serv_basic<br>
sc_serv_relay   - shows how to relay another source</p>
<p>There is more information about these example configurations in <a href="DNAS_Server.html#Example_Configurations">DNAS Server - section 8</a> and these are provided for those not happy with the 'setup mode' or 'configuration builder' mode or prefer to do things manually for specific configurations of the DNAS Server.</p>

<p><div class="serv"><a href="res/Console_Windows.png" title="DNAS Server Started on Windows"><img class="serv" alt="Setup Mode Running" src="res/Console_Windows.png"></a></div><br>To start the DNAS Server assuming the config file is either <b>sc_serv.conf</b> or <b>sc_serv.ini</b>, you just need to run the <b>sc_serv[.exe]</b> program file according to the operating system used:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sc_serv.exe</b> or <b>start.bat</b><br>
Non-Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>./sc_serv</b> or <b>./start.sh</b></p>
<p><br>This will load the DNAS Server with the details entered during setup (<a href="#DNAS_Server_Configuration_Setup">section 3.5.1</a>) or from an existing configuration when upgrading from an earlier version (<a href="#Upgrading_an_Existing_Install">section 3.5.1.1</a>).</p>
<div class="serv"><a href="res/Console_Linux.png" title="DNAS Server Started on Linux"><img class="serv" alt="Setup Mode Running" src="res/Console_Linux.png"></a></div>
<p><br>To start the DNAS Server with a specific configurartion file, enter the correct command string for the operating system you are using like the following where <b>&lt;conf&gt;</b> is the name of the configuration file in the same directory as the DNAS Server program file:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sc_serv.exe &lt;conf&gt;</b> (in the command-line) or drag and drop <b>&lt;conf&gt;</b> onto <b>sc_serv.exe</b><br>

<p><br>You can alternatively edit <b>start.bat</b> or <b>start.sh</b> (as applicable) and append <b>&lt;conf&gt;</b> to the end of the line and then run <b>start.bat</b> or <b>./start.sh</b> directly. If the <b>&lt;conf&gt;</b> file cannot be found, the DNAS Server will attempt to provide an appropriate file to use and will prompt you to select one if possible before failing and aborting running.</p>

<br><pre>This is needed if you want the Stream to be listed in the Directory. If not make
sure you have specified the DNAS Server to be private or do so in the Source.</pre>
<p><div class="thumb"><a href="res/Start.png" title="Server Summary Page"><img class="thumb" alt="Server Summary Page" src="res/Start.png"></a></div><br>With the DNAS Server running, if '<b>Auto-create Authhash</b>' was left checked during 'setup mode', when you first connect a Source then the DNAS Server will attempt to automatically generate an authhash for the Stream. It is highly recommended to check the details saved with the automatically created authhash to ensure it is correct and is what you expected. If it is not or you want to add additional information then you can edit it as detailed <a href="DNAS_Server_Authhash_Management.html#Updating"><b>here</b></a></p>
<p><br>If you have un-checked '<b>Auto-create Authhash</b>' during setup mode, then you will need to manually create the authhash for the stream(s) you want to be listed in the Directory. This is done via the '<b>Server Summary</b>' page when a valid source has been connected to the DNAS Server. See <a href="DNAS_Server_Authhash_Management.html#Creating"><b>here</b></a> for how to create an authhash.</p>
<p><br>You can also find additonal information on how to <a href="DNAS_Server_Authhash_Management.html#Manual_Editing">manually edit</a> an authhash such as when re-using an existing one to setup a server group or if setting up a different bitrate of an existing stream.</p>

<hr><br>
<pre>Skip this if you are not setting up the Transcoder for MP3 streaming.</pre>
<p><br>If you want to provide an MP3 stream and are going to use the Transcoder then you will need to obtain a license key in-order to unlock the support to do this in the tool. Details on how to obtain this can be found in <a href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_DNAS_Transcoder_2#Registering_for_MP3_Stream_Encoding">Transcoder - section 2.5</a>.</p><br>
<pre>AAC encoding does not need you to purchase a license as one has
already been paid for you as detailed in <a href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_DNAS_Transcoder_2#Why_Does_AAC_Encoding_Not_Require_a_License_Key.3F">Transcoder - section 2.5.1</a>.</pre>
<p><br>Once the key has been obtained you need to add the key and your name into the
'<b>unlockkeyname</b>' and '<b>unlockkeycode</b>' values in you configuration file exactly as they have been received. So if your key is '<b>123456</b>' and you have used '<b>Bob</b>' as the registered name, you would add the following to your Transcoder configuration file:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">unlockkeyname=Bob<br>
unlockkeycode=123456</p>

<a name="Transcoder_Configuration_Setup"></a><h2>3.6.2.&nbsp;Configuration Setup <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>Getting the Transcoder started you first need to open up the sc_trans_simple.conf example file in the root of the install location. Work through the file's contents and then fill in or change any of the values required for how you want to use the server.</p>
<p>If you are wanting to use MP3 encoding then make sure you have followed <a href=#MP3_Streaming_License>section 3.6.1</a> and entered the required '<b>unlockkeyname</b>' and '<b>unlockkeycode</b>' values in you configuration file exactly as they have been received. You will be informed when later running the Transcoder if there is an issue with the MP3 license details.</p>
<p><br>Once the key has been obtained you need to add the key and your name into the '<b>unlockkeyname</b>' and '<b>unlockkeycode</b>' values in you configuration file exactly as they have been received. So if your key is '<b>123456</b>' and you have used '<b>Bob</b>' as the registered name, you would add the following to your Transcoder configuration file:</p>

<hr>
<p>For simplicity we will only run the Transcoder in the command-line console though when your Transcoder setup is completed and everything is known to be working correctly then running as a service (Windows) or as a daemon (non-Windows) can be done to automate loading of the Transcoder.</p>
<p>To start the Transcoder instance you now need to enter the correct command string for the operating system you are using into the command-line console like the following which assumes using the base example configuration file in the same directory as the Transcoder program file:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">For Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sc_trans.exe sc_trans_simple.conf</b><br>
For non-Window&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>./sc_trans sc_trans_simple.conf</b></p>
<p><br>If you use one of the other example configuration files or a different one then you can just change 'sc_trans_simple.conf' to the name or full path to the configuration file.</p>
<p><br>For more information on running the Transcoder see sc_trans.txt and the relevant section for the operating system you are using:</p>
