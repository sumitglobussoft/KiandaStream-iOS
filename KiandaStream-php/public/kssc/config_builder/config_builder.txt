CaptureDeviceInput,Enter the Platform/OS dependent device name used for live capture.<br/><br/>Note: When run under Windows on an operating system newer than XP there is a possibility for the device name obtained from Windows to be longer than 32 characters. This is a problem as the api's used only support device names up to 31 characters in length so sc_trans will attempt to clip the device name specified with 'capturedevice' to 31 characters to try to get a match with the devices the OS is reporting.<br/><br/>If you are having issues with the live capture then enable Capture Debug to allow you to see the device names reported back to sc_trans by the OS.

ServerIntroFileInput,Enter the relative path and file name to the file the Transcoder will upload to the DNAS that is played when a listener first connects.<br/><br/>Note: With both of these options, they will override any files specified in the DNAS's configuration file and also requires the new SHOUTcast2 protocol for it to be supported (see <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_DNAS_Transcoder_2#Network_Options">section 3.11</a> for the options 'outprotocol' supports).<br/><br/>Additionally when connecting to the DNAS via the Transcoder, the server intro and backup files as specified in the DNAS configuration file (see sc_serv.txt - <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_DNAS_Server_2#Introduction_and_Backup_Files">section 4.5</a>) will not be played so you need to specify them in the Transcoder configuration if required for the stream (this is a quirk of how the Transcoder currently works.)

ResetButton,<span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;<u>WARNING</u>:&nbsp;</span> Only use this if you need to revert the configuration builder back to its default state as any changes you have made since starting will be lost and will need to be re-entered again.
CalendarEventAddButton,Add a calendar event.
Calendar	StartDateInput,Enter as yyyy/mm/dd<br/><br/>e.g. 2010/12/31<br/><br/>The 'Start Date' and 'End Date' settings indicate the date range the event is valid for otherwise the event will be ignored. Either value can be left out and if so then the event will be unbounded in that direction i.e. leaving 'Start Date' blank is the way to indicate the event takes effect when the Transcoder starts.
Calendar	EndDateInput,Enter as yyyy/mm/dd<br/><br/>e.g. 2010/12/31<br/><br/>The 'Start Date' and 'End Date' settings indicate the date range the event is valid for otherwise the event will be ignored. Either value can be left out and if so then the event will be unbounded in that direction i.e. leaving 'Start Date' blank is the way to indicate the event takes effect when the Transcoder starts.
Calendar	StartTimeInput,Enter as hh:mm:ss - 24 hour format<br/><br/>e.g. 23:59:59<br/><br/>The 'Start Time' and 'End Time' settings work in a similar manner to the date ones for the event but are used when the associated 'Start Date' is met. So if no 'Start Time' is entered then the event starts immediately on 'Start Date'. So as you can see this could be left out along with 'Start Date' to make events start always when sc_trans is started.
Calendar	DurationInput,Enter as hh:mm:ss - 24 hour format<br/><br/>e.g. 23:59:59<br/><br/>The 'Duration' setting is the length of the scheduled event and if this is not specified then the event will end when 'End Date' (if specified) is reached.
Calendar	TimeOffsetInput,Enter as hh:mm:ss - 24 hour format<br/><br/>e.g. 23:59:59<br/><br/>Time periodic events are those which occur at regular intervals and are defined by the'Start Time', 'Time Offset' and 'repeat' attributes allowing for control over the timeinterval between the event and the next instance of the event.<br/><br/>The 'Start Time' attribute is used to indicate the interval between this type of event andthe next time it will occur. So with a number of these events you can have a jingle playat a specific time during the day at a consistent time.<br/><br/>The 'Time Offset' atribute is used to indicate an offset from midnight at which theperiodic event will be applied relative to the 'Start Time' value. This will allow you tospecify a specific time during the interval so if you wanted to have an event which isactivated every hour but on the half hour you could do:<br/><br/>Time Offset: 00:30:00<br/>Start Time: 01:00:00<br/><br/><br/>If no other repeat field values are specified i.e. repeat isn't 128 the the event willbe valid for every day of the week. If other values are specified then the event will be restricted to those days specified<br/> e.g.<br/> repeat=190repeats the event only during weekdays<br/><br/><br/> Important Note: If you use this on a playlist event then the event will be activated at the specified time period after the last event successfully occurred but the required file(s) will not be played until the currently playing file has completed playing as playlist events add to the main playback queue and do not act as an instant event as the relay and DJ events do.
Calendar	PerCheckBox,Time periodic events are those which occur at regular intervals and are defined by the'Start Time', 'Time Offset' and 'repeat' attributes allowing for control over the timeinterval between the event and the next instance of the event.<br/><br/>The 'Start Time' attribute is used to indicate the interval between this type of event andthe next time it will occur. So with a number of these events you can have a jingle playat a specific time during the day at a consistent time.<br/><br/>The 'Time Offset' atribute is used to indicate an offset from midnight at which theperiodic event will be applied relative to the 'Start Time' value.

If other values are specified then the event will be restricted to those days specified<br/> e.g.<br/> repeat=190repeats the event only during weekdays<br/><br/><br/> Important Note: If you use this on a playlist event then the event will be activated at the specified time period after the last event successfully occurred but the required file(s) will not be played until the currently playing file has completed playing as playlist events add to the main playback queue and do not act as an instant event as the relay and DJ events do.

Calendar	EventDeleteButton,Remove the calendar event.
Calendar	EventTypeSelect,Select the type of the event; DJ, Playlist, or Relay
Calendar	DJNameInput,Enter the name of the DJ as configured in the Transcoder.<br/><br/>This is enabled in combination with the settings in the sc_trans configuration file for controlling DJ access. So for this to work you will also need to make sure you enable 'DJ Port / DJ SC2 Port' and to set any passwords and names in the sc_trans config file to match the event. See sc_trans.txt - <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_DNAS_Transcoder_2#DJ_Support">section 3.3</a> for more information setting up DJ support.
Calendar	DJArchiveSelect,Select if the DJ show is to be archived (captured.)<br/><br/>Inherit - Use value set for 'DJ Capture' in the Transcoder configuration.<br/>Yes - Always capture.<br/>No - Never capture.
Calendar	PlaylistNameInput,The playlists are those defined by the 'playlistfilename' and 'playlistfilepath' entries in your Transcoder configuration file which allows for multiple playlists to be accessed by this event type.
