; NOTE: for any relative paths specified are relative to
; sc_serv and not to where the conf file is being stored

; here are all of the available debug logging options from
; sc_serv so to make it easier to debug options with your
; current setup then you just need to include this file in
; e.g. adding include=sc_serv_debug.conf to your config
; see sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.3 for details about these

; enable or disable the different debug loggging options as
; required for any issues you are trying to investigate.
;
; you can disable an entry by adding a comma (;) infront of
; the configuration entry
